## FluentFTP
A nifty FTP/FTPS library for .NET and .NET Core, optimized for speed. Provides extensive FTP commands, file uploads/downloads, SSL/TLS connections and FTP proxies. It supports high-level upload/download commands so you don't have to get into the nitty gritty Stream API stuff, which is still there if you need it.
